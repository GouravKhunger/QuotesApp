# Details
[Watch the demo video on Youtube](https://youtu.be/9Kl6WDmTK8g)

This App has useful features, such as bookmarks, to save the quotes that you find motivating, and keep them in a
separated section. Moreover, there are a number of cool transition and animation affects, which makes navigation much
cooler.

Long pressing a quote in your Bookmarks copies that quote to the clipboard... More features along the way ðŸš€.
